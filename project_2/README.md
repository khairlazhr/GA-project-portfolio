Project 2 - T. Triad

A recreation of a fan-made tracker on the mini-game known as Triple Triad in the popular Final Fantasy 14 Online MMORPG game. You can check my recreation here at:

It's still a work in progress as I'm still learning the ropes and will implement future updates to make the site more user-friendly as well as add more services for users to use.

The Beginning

I started this project with the idea in mind to recreate a fan-made tracker that currently exists with what I have learned so far throughout the course. The database API was provided by said tracker and I was glad to be able to re-create the tracker as faithfully as possible. However, I knew, with the limited time given for the project, I would not be able to fully recreate the tracker. Hence, with the recommendations from the instructors, I proceeded onto creating the tracker with the cards and decks sections in mind.
As I started the project, I planned on an overall simple architecture for the website. The sections would include a homepage with an about section, a cards section where users will be able to look at the cards available in the mini game (index and show route), a decks section where users can share and compare decks (index, show, new/create, edit/update and delete route) as well as a secure user route where users can signup/login to access their account.

The Process

As the project progressed, I faced several difficulties. One such difficulty that I faced was the implementation of features that I wanted to put into the website. Such features were things that we had to learn on our own and it tested my ability to learn how to implement such features in a short time. In hindsight, I should have focused on getting the overall site structure and design done instead of focusing my attention towards said features. I had to question myself at times whether the said feature was needed. In the end, I did implement some of the features that I wanted in the site and several others that I had to sacrifice to ensure I hit the standard for a Minimum Viable Product. 

I learned that it is essential for proper planning at the very beginning given the time frame to know your limits and strive to implement what you can. In that regard, I felt that I went into the project with insufficient planning and hope I can do better next time. There are features that I failed implement such as a back-to-top button and the ability to add cards to the user collection. Hopefully, I would be able to implement this in the future.

Another difficulty I faced was the implementation of the user system onto the site. I felt that once I got the site running, it was difficult for me to keep track and implement the user system onto the existing routes. In hindsight, I should have done better in knowing where I need to implement the user system and integrate it better. I believe, moving forward, I need to know how a feature would affect the project and its components as well as implement it so I do not have to keep going back to fix the individual routes.

Conclusion

Overall, I felt that I could have done better in learning how to implement the features I wanted to put in the site. Given the time frame, I did what I could in getting the tracker working but there are still many improvements that could be made to the site, feature-wise as well as design-wise. Stay tuned for future improvements! Thank you for reading.
